Foundations of Biology II (BIOL2003)

In a group paper, my group and I proposed a research methodology to study the interaction of p75 neurotrophin factor and the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABVG), 
as well as the interaction of STAT1 and the rabies virus phosphoprotein (RABVP). This repository contains code we used to analyze our hypothetical data.
